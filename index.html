                    to assume that things you've never tried are possible, at least until you've tried them and have
                    evidence. And it's good to remember that there's a whole range of 'possible' in between never-tried
                    and professional-level. For example, I'm 68 and have never learned to play a musical instrument. I'm
                    pretty sure that I can't possibly become a concert pianist. I'm also pretty sure that I could learn
                    enough to play simple songs on a piano. What level of piano skill "is possible" for me? Only by
                    trying could I find out. </p>

                <h1>My failure of<br>previous year</h1>
                <p>Hi as people says things happen for a reason. Its just 1 exam right. I happened to failed 4 years
                    continuously in 1st year then lost all the hopes. But that was a turning point in my life, I got to
                    learn what I was good at and then started following it with all the hard work. Then later got a
                    break in MNC even without having received my degree. And made some name for myself in every project
                    I worked in. So dont worry my friend, have some faith in yourself and you can change your life.</p>
